Problems that there exists polynomial-time algorithms are [[tractable problems]].
* The complexity function are $O(p(n))$ where $p(n)$ is a polynomial.

Problems that are proven to be not solvable with polynomial-time algorithms are [[intractable problems]].
* Typically, algorithms proposed to this class of problems are of enumerative nature (exhaustive search), and are of exponential complexity
* The complexity function are $O(c^n)$ where $c > 1$

# Classes of complexity

## P

The class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by deterministic algorithms.

## NP

The class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by non-deterministic algorithms.

## NP-complete

The class of problems that are the hardest problems in NP.

## NP-hard

The class of problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.

## Exp

The class of problems to which exists exponential-time algorithms at best.
